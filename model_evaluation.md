# Model Evaluation

Model Used:
Logistic Regression

Problem Type:
Binary classification (Delayed vs Not Delayed)

Evaluation Metric:
Accuracy

Observed Accuracy:
~70–80% (depends on random split)

Why Logistic Regression?
- Simple and fast
- Easy to interpret
- Suitable for small datasets
- Ideal for hackathon demos

Limitations:
- Small dummy dataset
- Does not learn from real-time updates
- Accuracy can improve with more data

Future Improvements:
- Add more historical task data
- Try Random Forest for better accuracy
- Include real-time task progress
